Command Serializer is intended to help C programmers write custom Web-based applications.
Developing a web-based application is broken into 3 parts:

1) Write your application as a console application, using getchar, and printf.
2) Add #include <comsever.h> to your code
3) Link in libcomserver.a into your application
4) Modify your code to use coGetc and coPrintf rather than getc and printf

The passwdserver.c application should provide you with a very simple framework for building yor
web based app. and login_cgi.c should provide a decent example for writing a CGI "script" in C.
Please read comserver.h and comclient.h for a detailed description of the interface to the two
libraries.  The client.c program is a command-line interface to your application, which you can
run while users are accessing it through the web.
