Command Serializer is intended to help C programmers write custom Web-based applications.
Developing a web-based application is broken into 3 parts:

1) Write your application as a console application, using getchar, and printf.
2) Link in libcomserver.a into your application, and modify your code to use coGetc and coPrintf.
3) Write an Apache CGI "script", based on the example login_cgi.c file, which links in libcomclient.a

The example_backend.c application should provide you with a very simple framework for building yor
web based app. and login_cgi.c should provide a decent example for writing a CGI "script" in C.
Please read comserver.h and comclient.h for a detailed description of the interface to the two
libraries.
