Command Serializer is intended to help C programmers write custom Web-based applications.  Developing a web-based
application is broken into 3 parts:

1) Write your application as a command-line driven console application, using getchar(), and such.  Make it possible for
your application to execute commands in a file.
2) Run comserial to create a file under /tmp from which your application can read.  Command Serializer will listen for
TCP connections, just like MySQL, and any text received will be piped through the file to your application.
3) Write an Apache CGI "script", based on the example apachetool.c file.  Each web query will result in a command being
written through Command Serializer to your application.

The example application should provide you with a very simple framework for building yor web based app.
